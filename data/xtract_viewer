Usage:
    xtract_viewer -dir <xtractDir> [options]

    Compulsory arguments:

       -dir FOLDER                       Path to XTRACT output folder

    Optional arguments:

       -str STRUCTURE,STRUCTURE,...      Structures (comma separated (default = display all that is found in input folder)

       -thr NUMBER NUMBER                The lower and upper thresholds applied to the tracts for viewing
                                         Default = 0.001 0.1

       -brain                            The brain image to use for the background overlay - must be in the same space as tracts.
                                         Default is the FSL_HCP065_FA map
